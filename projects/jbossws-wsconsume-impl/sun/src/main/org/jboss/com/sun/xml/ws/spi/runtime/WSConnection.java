/**
 * Captures many transports that are used to talk with WS endpoints.
 * 
 * For endpoints deployed in light weight http server in J2SE, the implemenation
 * of this class uses HttpTransaction to read from or write to stream.
 *
 * For endpoints deployed in servlet container, the implementation of this
 * class uses HttpServletRequest to read a request, and uses HttpServletResponse
 * to write response.
 *
 * This also works for local transport, JMS transport.
 *
 * Runtime can access to the implementation of this interface using
 * messageInfo.getConnection()
